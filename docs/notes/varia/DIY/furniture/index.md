## To do, or not to do, that is the question
Sometimes you can not buy. If pockets are deep, you can do visual design and order. However, if you have space, you can make simpler pieces at the factory quality level. You need a mitre saw ( with high tooth count), a drilling machine, and a handheld cordless drill. I have only one tip to share. If you have more than one hole to drill, then take the time to make a TEMPLATE. It will save you considerable time, and all your holes are within an acceptable margin of error.

## A meditative state
Drilling hundreds of holes and not letting your mind wander takes much attention. It's a form of meditation if you are stressed. What do men do in quality time? They drill holes. What men speak during that process - nothing!  
When you do not need those pieces of artwork later in life, a long line of people is waiting to adopt what you no longer need.
