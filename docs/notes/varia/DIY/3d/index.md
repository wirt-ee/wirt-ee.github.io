title: 3D printing and design

Everything physical has a form. A 3D printer is a tool to shape this form.  
Suddenly, you can reverse engineer replacement parts for home appliances that you otherwise have to throw away entirely. You can pull things out of your imagination. Or you can take someone's design and iterate on it to become more useful. Nowadays, you don't have to be excellent at CAD, describe what you want, give basic dimensions, and LLM will do it for you. Every machine is unique. Here's mine.

## What can be done
You are neck deep if you can scrape a reasonable pile of objects from your desk at any random point.

## Tips
Let's cut the **BS** and list some tips that worked for me:  

* A small nozzle of 0.25 means a considerable failure rate. Also, skip standard 0.4 and go with 0.6 mm hardened steel.
* Use carbon fibre PLA to get rid of warping.
* Slim film pressure probes are the best for bead levelling.
* Coat the print bead with Aquastop. With a heated bead, this thing sticks and lasts for years.
* Get a box around your printer.
* Use a text-based OpenScad modeller because the design is the code, and LLMs are extremely helpful with code.
* Use a piece of soft wire and Inescape to perform reverse engineering of complex shapes without a scanner.
