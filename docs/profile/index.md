## Purpose
We are right pick in those situations where technical expertise is needed, but the requestor doesn't want to know anything about [academia](https://ut.ee/).  
Then we have a few options:  

* Convince business owners to work with academia
* Offer services for free (not likely, but one can hope) or denay request
* Use this compays governing body to provide the requested service   

## Experience
Our Openstack cloud journey started in 2016 with the Mitaka release.  
Ceph storage utilisation started around 2017 with Jewel release. Mainly because commercial, supported solution IOPS was lower than expected.   
Vyos HA firewall started in 2022 out of necessity from Equuleus. The previous corporate firewall support price was way beyond imagination.  
Since everything above is always live upgraded, we have solid recipes that work in real life.  

## Team
Academia [PhD](https://www.etis.ee/CV/Hannes_Tamme/eng/) graded, well paid technical support personnel.  
We politely refuse when a conflict of interest or massive academic [infrastructure](https://hpc.ut.ee/) suits you better.  

## Requests 
<a href="mailto:info@wirt.ee">info@wirt.ee</a> in English or Estonian.  
          
## Pricing
Baseline is same as academia officials 60 â‚¬/h.
