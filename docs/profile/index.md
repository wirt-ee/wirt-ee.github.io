## Purpose
We are riht pick in those situations where technical expertise is needed, but the requestor has nothing to do and doesn't want to know anything about academic infrastructure.  
Then we have a few options:  

* Convince business owners to work with academia 
* Offer services for free (not likely , but one can hope) or denay request
* Use this compays governing body to provide the requested service   

## Team
Academia [PhD](https://www.etis.ee/CV/Hannes_Tamme/eng/) graded, well paid technical support personnel.  
We politely refuse when a conflict of interest or massive academic infrastructure suits you better.  

## Requests 
<a href="mailto:info@wirt.ee">info@wirt.ee</a> in English or Estonian. This page language reflects the default server LOCALE. It's hard to invent terminology or quote everything.
          
## Pricing
Same as academia officials, usually reviewed yearly.
