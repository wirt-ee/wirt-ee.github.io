#Company

We are an Estonia-based IT consulting and administration team. Our main objective is to deploy and maintain Linux based infrastructure.  
We have solid competence to manage Openstack cloud, Ceph storage, Vyos firewall clusters and network between those components.  
Like any well-seasoned system administrator, we have long-term experiences, from plain software bugs to total system blackouts and everything in between.  
We will sweat for you when the rubber hits the road, so you don't have to.
