#Company

We are an Estonia-based IT consulting and administration team. Our main objective is to manage Linux based infrastructure.  
We have solid competence to manage Openstack cloud, Ceph storage, Vyos firewall clusters and network between those components.  
Like any good system administrator, we have long-term experiences, from plain software bugs to total system blackouts.
